                              I'm a Full Stack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer" target="_blank">Software Developer</a>.
                              I started writing code in 2011 using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C</a> first
                              then <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, which was much easier to work with.
                              Using the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle" target="_blank">Python Turtle</a> I drew my first graphic on screen, and I was hooked on coding ever since.
                            Software has always fascinated me, I wanted to write code for
                              video games and eventually I learned how to do this first using <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a> (<a href="https://www.openprocessing.org/user/38862" target="_blank">sketches here</a>).
                            Around this time I started learning JavaScript which paired well with Processing, and while Processing is great, I needed something more feature dense and suited for games,
                            so I picked up <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity3D</a>, where I started with
                              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">C#</a>. I built a series of games like <a href="https://github.com/jmoceri34/scrap-metal" target="_blank">Scrap Metal</a>, a first person multiplayer shooter with a team of 5 in college, and more (they're available on GitHub).
                            From there I began
                              my career as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_developer" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Developer</a>, where I worked with databases such as
                            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx" target="_blank">SQL Server</a>,
                              <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="_blank">PostgreSQL</a>, writing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL" target="_blank">SQL</a> queries, stored procedures,
                            and more that were part of many 3rd party integrations. I did a lot of database schema design, management, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">DevOps</a> working with a small team. Things like
                            setting up Build Pipelines on Visual Studio Team Services, automating tasks using powershell, deployment to virtual machines, participating in pull request peer review and mentorship, IT support, QA, unit and integration tests, management and watching of multiple applications using homebrew
                            software custom written to deliver and receive updates (push systems). Many of these systems were integrated into a SaaS platform built for the business to manage their clients and products. The platform was written in AngularJS
                            with a .NET MVC 5 Web API Backend using OAuth authentication. I was part of a team that migrated and delivered this platform using an agile methodology in bi-weekly sprints. The team and business decided to migrate to the cloud, using both Amazon and Microsoft Azure to host and run software, including the following products for Amazon:
                              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/" target="_blank">EC2</a>,
                              their service for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue" target="_blank">message queues</a> (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank">SQS</a>),
                              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ses/" target="_blank">Simple Email Service</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/" target="_blank">Elastic Beanstalk</a>,
                              <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/" target="_blank">RDS</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWS_Lambda" target="_blank">Lambda</a>; and the following products for Microsoft:
                              <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/" target="_blank">Key Vault</a>
                              and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/webjobs-create" target="_blank">WebJobs</a>. In my career and personal projects moving forward I've also used these technologies, and applied and built upon these ideas.
                            Recently, I've spent time working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC" target="_blank">WebRTC</a>
                            and multiple integrations with 3rd-party providers for video chat, the ability to text phones using a web browser, and other real-time communications using .NET and Angular.
                            I have a huge passion for game design and design in general and so in my spare time I love to
                            work on indie video game development.
